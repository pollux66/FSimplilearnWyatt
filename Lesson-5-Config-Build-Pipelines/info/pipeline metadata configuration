- Discard Old Builds:                                         self explanatory
- Do not allow concurrent builds:                             self explanatory
- Do not allow the pipeline to resume if the master restarts: self explanatory
- Github project:                                             self explanatory
- Pipeline speed/durability override:                         By default data is persisted to disk in the event of picking where
                                                              left off. If this is selected, it is less likely that the job
                                                              will be able to pick-up if pipeline is restarted. Benefits are
                                                              more performance based.
- Preserve stashes from completed builds:                     Like a cache. Holds files of inputs and outpute that are used throughout
                                                              the build and goes away once pipeline is completed.
                                                              When checked, preserves "cache" to disk for reuse across runs.
- This project is parameterized:
- Throttle builds:                                            Enforces minimum time between builds. Typically done one eternal resources
                                                              needs time to prepare.
